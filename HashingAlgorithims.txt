SHA-256
   

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is HMAC?
HMAC is a keyed-hash function, meaning it combines:

A secret key (shared between sender and receiver).
A hash function (SHA-256 in this case).
The message (e.g., JWT Header + Payload).
It is used for data integrity and authentication.



 How HMAC SHA-256 Works Internally
HMAC applies SHA-256 twice in a secure way using two specially derived keys.

üîπ Steps of HMAC SHA-256
Prepare the Secret Key

If the key is longer than the SHA-256 block size (64 bytes), it is hashed first.
If the key is shorter, it is padded with zeros to make it 64 bytes.
Create Two Keys

Inner Key (ipad): XOR the secret key with 0x36.
Outer Key (opad): XOR the secret key with 0x5C.
First Hash (Inner Hash)

Concatenate ipad with the message.
Apply SHA-256 to get the inner hash.
 
InnerHash = SHA-256( ipad + message )



Second Hash (Outer Hash)

Concatenate opad with the inner hash.
Apply SHA-256 again to get the final HMAC.

HMAC = SHA-256( opad + InnerHash )
